# Pipeline prep

> This does the preprocessing of the initial data to enter the sampling algorithm. 
> At the same time, it returns the necessary elements to classify and scale the points retrieved. 

## Overview
In this pipeline a scaler is constructed to make all features and targets values go from 0 to 1, 
according to the selected boundaries.
It also constructs a class that contains all the information necessary to classify the points, according to
the region of interest.
With these tools, it also returns the initial data set, prepared to be enlarged.

## Pipeline inputs

* **Node: fit_scaler**
  * log_scale: Define if a logarithmic scale should be used when scaling, defined in 'parameters:log_scale',
  * features: Physical variables known, limited by the design space, defined in 'parameters:features',
  * targets: Physical variables of interest, which cannot be fixed but are to be known after simulating, defined in 'parameters:targets',
  * variables_ranges: Boundaries of the design space, defined in 'parameters/prep:variables_ranges'.

* **Node: preparation**
  * initial_data: Initial data set to be used to train the surrogate containing values in physical scales, defined in 'catalog:initial_data',
  * features: from 'params:features',
  * targets: from 'params:targets',
  * additional_values: Other values of interest that the user wishes to keep track (but not use), defined in 'parameters:additional_values',
  * variables_ranges: Definition of the design space (boundaries for each variable), defined in 'parameters/prep:variables_ranges',                          
  * interest_region: Boundaries of the targets that will define the region of interest, defined in 'parameters:interest_region',
  * sim_time_cutoff: Maximum time of simulation allowed to obtain ground truth of targets, defined in 'parameters/prep:sim_time_cutoff',
  * scaler: Class that contains the parameters needed to transform the design space into a space between 0 and 1, defined in 'catalog:scaler'.

## Pipeline outputs

* **Node: preparation**
  * treated_data: Initial data treated to be used to train the surrogate, defined in 'catalog:treated_data',

  for the values already scaled, defined in 'catalog:treatment'.
